// Algorithm adapted from the GE-1 pure engine (supabase/functions/_shared/

// the client bundle (server-authoritative guardrail in vitest.config.ts), so
// this module re-implements only the calculation layer with plain numbers:
// side-pot layering from per-player total contributions, plus uncalled-bet
// detection. No deck, no shuffle, no winner logic — calculation only.
//
// Invariant: sum(pots[].amount) + (uncalled?.amount ?? 0) === sum(total_bet).
