// src/lib/onlinePoker/types.ts
// GE-2D shell — client-side PUBLIC view types for online poker.
//
// These MIRROR the server's WirePublicHandState (the JSON persisted in
// online_poker_hands.state) but are defined LOCALLY on purpose: the client bundle
// must never import the engine/adapter under supabase/functions/** (the engine
// runs only in the Edge runtime; the client sends intent and renders public state).
//
// Conventions that match the server contract:
//   * chips are decimal STRINGS, never JS numbers (precision is lost past 2^53);
//   * cards are 2-char strings like "Ah" / "Td"; the public view never carries a
//     hidden hole card — only `revealedCards` (showdown) and the caller's own
//     `myHoleCards` (fetched separately via op_get_my_hole_cards) ever appear.

/** Hard in-shell gate. While false the table is mock-only and EVERY action is
 *  disabled. Flips true only when the GE-2C runtime (migration 20260820000000 +
 *  online_poker_config.enabled) is live AND the client is wired to it.
 *  ON (closed alpha 2026-06-17): runtime migrations live, edge deployed.
 *  online_poker_config.enabled=true is set via separate controlled DB op before
 *  gameplay; while still false the edge returns disabled gracefully. */
