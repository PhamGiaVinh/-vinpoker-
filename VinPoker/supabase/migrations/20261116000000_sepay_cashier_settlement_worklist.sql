-- SePay ingestion — Patch 2c: read-only cashier settlement worklist RPC.
--
-- SOURCE-ONLY migration. NOT applied on merge. Apply in a controlled session (Supabase SQL Editor /
-- Management API), NOT the automated DB-deploy path. schema_migrations untouched.
--
-- WHY: the Floor/Cashier "Đối soát SePay" tab must show the reconcile worklist, but a cashier CANNOT
-- read bank_transactions directly (its RLS is super_admin OR club-OWNER only), and a flag-only
-- exact-match candidate writes NO settlement row — so a direct table query surfaces nothing. This
-- SECURITY DEFINER reader bridges that gap for cashiers, scoped to their own clubs.
--
-- RAW FACTS ONLY — NO computed verdict. It does NOT mirror settle_bank_transaction's decision tree
-- (that would duplicate logic and drift). It returns: the resolved club, amount, content, txn_ref,
-- occurred_at, the parsed reference_code (via the shared IMMUTABLE sepay_parse_reference_code — a
-- deterministic util, not a verdict), the registration match COUNT, and — only when exactly one match
-- — that registration's facts (id, player, tournament, status, total_pay) + amount_delta, plus the bt's
-- latest payment_settlements outcome/reason. The UI shows the numbers side by side; the cashier eyeballs
-- the comparison; manual_confirm_bank_transaction is the SOLE authoritative validator when they click.
--
-- SCOPE / SECURITY: derives the cashier's clubs from public.cashier_club_ids(auth.uid()) INTERNALLY
-- (= club_cashiers ∪ clubs.owner_id; 20260512184948) — no spoofable club param; empty if no auth.uid().
-- Only returns transfers whose resolved club ∈ the caller's clubs. Account→club resolved exactly as
-- settle does (platform_bank_accounts, exactly one active club); unresolved-club transfers are excluded
-- (a super_admin concern). The registration match is ALSO scoped to that resolved club (a reg counts /
-- attaches only when its tournament's club = the transfer's club) so the worklist never surfaces a
-- cross-club reg that manual_confirm_bank_transaction would then reject as club_mismatch — the UI mirrors
-- the validator. EXECUTE to authenticated ONLY. No writes.
--
-- Idempotent: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION; explicit REVOKE/GRANT.
