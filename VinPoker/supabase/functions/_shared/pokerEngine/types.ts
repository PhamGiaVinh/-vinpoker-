// supabase/functions/_shared/pokerEngine/types.ts
//
// Pure types for the VinPoker No-Limit Hold'em rules engine.
// ZERO external imports. Imported by Deno (Edge), the future actor server, and
// Vitest — NEVER by the client (the @engine alias is vitest-only on purpose).
//
// ── CHIP TYPE (locked) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// All chip/pot/stack amounts are `bigint` internally — never `number`, never
// float (a JS number loses precision past 2^53 and rounds money). Any future
// persistence or transport layer MUST serialize chips as DECIMAL STRINGS
// (e.g. amount.toString()), never as a JS number. See views.ts:serializeForTransport.
//
// ── POT / COMMITTED CONVENTION (locked) ───────────────────────────────────
// `pot` is the running GROSS pot and ALREADY INCLUDES every chip committed on
// the current street (chips are swept into `pot` the instant they leave a stack).
// `committed` (this street) and `totalCommitted` (all streets) are ACCOUNTING
// METADATA used only for legal-action sizing and side-pot construction.
// NEVER compute total chips as `stack + pot + committed` — that double-counts.
// The one conservation invariant is:   Σ(seat.stack) + pot === initialTotal.
