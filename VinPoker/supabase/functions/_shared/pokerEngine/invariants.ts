// Runtime invariant checker for HandState — defense-in-depth for the server
// runtime and the replay/audit path. Pure and read-only: it never mutates the
// state it inspects. The engine's reducers are already property-tested; this
// module lets the PERSISTENCE layer (and replays of stored hands) cheaply
// verify that a state it loaded or produced is still self-consistent before
// trusting it.
//
// The one conservation invariant (locked): Σ(seat.stack) + pot === initialTotal.
// NEVER add `committed` — those chips are already inside `pot` (gross-pot rule).
