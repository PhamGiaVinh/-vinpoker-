# Remote Schema Baseline — Draft Review

**Migration file:** `VinPoker/supabase/migrations/20260611000001_remote_only_schema_baseline.sql`  
**Status:** DRAFT — not applied to any DB  
**Created:** 2026-06-11  
**Source metadata:** `D:\vinpoker-prod-audit-20260611-051112\`

---

## Why This Migration Must Not Be Applied Yet

1. **D4a not approved.** The 99 remote-only migration versions have not been added to the CI repair list. Until they are, `supabase db push` will refuse to run because it sees those versions in `schema_migrations` but finds no local file for them.

2. **Baseline must be marked `--status applied` on remote dev DB before push.** All objects in this file already exist on the remote dev DB. If this migration runs without being pre-marked as applied, it will attempt to re-create them. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` are safe, but RLS policies wrapped in `duplicate_object` guards will silently skip — the trigger recreation (`DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` + `CREATE TRIGGER`) is idempotent. However, pushing this migration before marking it applied means the migration runner will try to "apply" it on an already-populated DB, which wastes a migration slot and risks partial failures on FK constraint re-additions.

3. **Migration ordering relative to `pass1b_circuit_breaker.sql`.** `force_release_stuck_assignment()` and the deferred `disable_stale_audit_flags()` / `enable_audit_for_stuck_rows()` reference `dealer_assignments.should_audit_version`. That column is added by `20260725000001_pass1b_circuit_breaker.sql`. This baseline must apply before or at the same time as that migration on a fresh build. On the remote dev DB both already exist.

4. **Permanent skip: `20260609000002_recalculate_june_payroll.sql`.** This migration recalculates all June 2026 dealer payroll records. It must be added to the CI repair list as `--status reverted` (D3d decision, 2026-06-11). It is NOT included in this baseline and must never be auto-applied. See `migration-recovery-decisions.md`.

## Objects Intentionally Excluded

| Object | Reason |
|---|---|
| `disable_stale_audit_flags()` | Runtime dependency on `dealer_assignments.should_audit_version` (added by `pass1b_circuit_breaker.sql`, a pending local migration). Function creates fine but fails at runtime. Deferred until `pass1b_circuit_breaker` is confirmed applied. |
| `enable_audit_for_stuck_rows()` | Same dependency as above. |
| `dealer_state_health` (view) | Full view DDL not reconstructable without `pg_dump` (Docker banned). Monitoring-only; no functional app dependency. |
| `ghost_assignments_health` (view) | Same as above. |
| `v_stuck_assignment_version_history` (view) | Same as above. |
| `20260609000002_recalculate_june_payroll.sql` | **Permanent repair-revert** (D3d). One-time financial data mutation. Must never auto-apply. See `migration-recovery-decisions.md`. |

External dependencies (must exist before this migration runs on a fresh build):

- `public.clubs` — FK target for `club_trackers.club_id`
- `auth.users` — FK target for `club_trackers.granted_by` and `tournament_hand_audit_log.actor_id`
- `public.tournament_hands` — FK target for `tournament_hand_audit_log.hand_id` and trigger source
- `public.dealer_payroll` — FK target for `payroll_calculation_log.payroll_id`
- `public.has_role()` — used in `club_trackers` RLS policies and `is_club_tracker()`/`tracker_club_ids()`
- `public.swing_escalation_config` — used by `get_escalation_config()` and `force_release_stuck_assignment()`
- `public.transition_dealer_state()` — used by `reconcile_ghost_assignments()`
- `public.club_settings` — used by `club_local_date()`
- `public.dealer_assignments`, `public.dealer_attendance`, `public.dealers`, `public.game_tables`, `public.dealer_breaks`, `public.audit_logs`, `public.swing_audit_logs`, `public.diagnostic_logs` — used by various functions

All of the above are created by existing local migration files. This baseline migration should run after all prior local migrations on a fresh build.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `granted_by` FK target in `club_trackers` assumed to be `auth.users(id)` — not confirmed from metadata | LOW | Verify before applying to a fresh DB. On remote dev DB the table already exists; this migration skips creation via IF NOT EXISTS. |
| `tournament_hand_audit_log` actor_id FK assumed `auth.users(id)` — not confirmed | LOW | Same mitigation. |
| ON DELETE clauses for FKs (CASCADE / SET NULL) inferred from naming convention and standard Supabase patterns, not extracted from metadata directly | MEDIUM | Run `SELECT conname, confdeltype FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'club_trackers'::regclass` to verify before applying to production. |
| `reconcile_dealer_states` Step 3 contains `Dass.status` (capital D) — case inconsistency | LOW | Copied as-is from live DB for fidelity. PostgreSQL folds identifiers to lowercase so `Dass` = `dass` at parse time; no runtime error expected. Noted for review. |
| `tournament_break_all_tables` inserts into `dealer_breaks` using columns `started_at`, `duration_minutes`, `reason` | MEDIUM | `get_swing_metrics()` references `dealer_breaks.break_start` and `dealer_breaks.expected_duration_minutes`. Column naming inconsistency between the two functions copied from live DB. Verify actual `dealer_breaks` column names before calling `tournament_break_all_tables` in production. |
| `force_release_stuck_assignment` sets `should_audit_version = false` — column added by `pass1b_circuit_breaker.sql` | LOW | Function creates fine; fails at runtime only if `pass1b_circuit_breaker` not yet applied. On remote dev DB both exist. |
| `reconcile_ghost_assignments` checks `result->>'success'` but `transition_dealer_state` returns key `'ok'` | LOW | Latent logic bug: `v_current_ok` always resolves to `FALSE` even on successful transition, causing ghost assignments to be skipped rather than fixed. Copied from live DB as-is. Requires a separate bugfix migration to correct the key name. |
| Broad RLS on `payroll_calculation_log` (SELECT and ALL with `qual = true` for `public` role) | MEDIUM | Pre-existing design; not changed in this baseline. Any authenticated user can read all payroll calculation logs. Flag for future tightening. |
| `tournament_hand_audit_log` INSERT policy uses `with_check = true` — any authenticated user can write audit rows regardless of club membership | LOW | Pre-existing design; consistent with trigger-driven audit pattern where the audit writer is the trigger (SECURITY DEFINER). Not changed here. |

---

## Assumptions

1. `club_trackers.granted_by` references `auth.users(id)` (standard Supabase user pattern).
2. `tournament_hand_audit_log.actor_id` references `auth.users(id)`.
3. FK ON DELETE clauses: CASCADE for child→parent (club_trackers→clubs, tournament_hand_audit_log→tournament_hands, payroll_calculation_log→dealer_payroll); SET NULL for user references (granted_by, actor_id).
4. `diagnostic_logs` exists in local migrations (not in remote-only list from Stage 2A).
5. All functions copied verbatim from live DB definitions in `19_function_definitions.json` — no logic changes made.
6. `rls_auto_enable_trigger` event trigger name not confirmed from metadata — name assumed from standard convention; may already exist under a different name. Duplicate-object guard prevents failure if so.

---

## Unresolved Questions

| ID | Question | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | What is the exact ON DELETE action for `club_trackers_club_id_fkey`, `club_trackers_granted_by_fkey`, `tournament_hand_audit_log_hand_id_fkey`? | Verify before applying to a fresh DB |
| Q2 | Does `dealer_breaks` use `break_start`/`expected_duration_minutes` or `started_at`/`duration_minutes`? `tournament_break_all_tables` uses the latter; `get_swing_metrics` uses the former. | Verify before calling `tournament_break_all_tables` in production |
| Q3 | What is the exact event trigger name already on remote dev DB (from the 99 remote-only versions)? | Duplicate-object guard handles it, but the name is assumed |
| Q4 | Should `disable_stale_audit_flags` and `enable_audit_for_stuck_rows` be included with a runtime-only risk note, or deferred to a second baseline migration after `pass1b_circuit_breaker` is confirmed? | Low priority; does not block D4a/D5e |
| Q5 | `reconcile_ghost_assignments` result key bug: fix here or in a separate migration? | Low urgency; ghost assignments still visible via direct query |

## Stage 3D — Baseline Safety Patches (2026-06-11)

Applied after Stage 3C static review. All changes are to `20260611000001_remote_only_schema_baseline.sql` only.

### Fixes applied

| ID | Issue | Fix applied |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | `audit_tournament_hand()` — `SECURITY DEFINER` without `SET search_path` | Added `SET search_path TO 'public'` to function header |
| F2 | `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER rls_auto_enable_trigger` — global DDL interceptor that silently affects all future `CREATE TABLE` operations in all subsequent migrations | Commented out the entire `DO $$ BEGIN CREATE EVENT TRIGGER ... END $$` block. `rls_auto_enable()` function definition retained. `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER` replaced with explanatory deferred comment. |
| F3 | `is_club_tracker()` and `tracker_club_ids()` — used in RLS policies without `SET search_path` | Added `SET search_path TO 'public'` to both function headers. **SECURITY INVOKER intentionally preserved** — not changed to SECURITY DEFINER in this baseline. |
| F4 | `club_local_date()` — `SECURITY DEFINER` without `SET search_path` | Added `SET search_path TO 'public'` to function header |
| F5 | `tournament_break_all_tables()` — `SECURITY DEFINER` without `SET search_path` | Added `SET search_path TO 'public'` to function header |
| F6 | Trigger `trg_audit_tournament_hand` — undocumented column dependency on `20260617000000_realtime_hand_tracking.sql` | Added ordering comment above `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` noting that `tournament_hands.{status, created_by, locked_by_user_id, locked_at}` are added by `20260617000000`, and that no migrations in the window write to `tournament_hands` |

### Pre-existing live DB bugs intentionally NOT fixed

The following bugs exist on the live DB and are faithfully preserved in the baseline. Fixing them here would diverge the baseline from the live DB state and is out of scope.

| Bug | Location | Future action |
|---|---|---|
| `result->>'success'` vs `'ok'` in `reconcile_ghost_assignments` | Function body | Separate bugfix migration post-baseline |
| `started_at`/`duration_minutes` vs `break_start`/`expected_duration_minutes` in `tournament_break_all_tables` | Function body | Separate bugfix migration post-baseline |
| `payroll_calculation_log` RLS policies use `TO public` (anon-readable) | Section 5 policies | Separate RLS tightening migration |
| `tournament_hand_audit_log` INSERT policy `WITH CHECK (true)` (any auth user can insert) | Section 5 policies | Separate RLS tightening migration |
| `p_released_by` dead parameter in `release_dealer_from_table` | Function signature | Low priority |
| `Dass.status` cosmetic case inconsistency in `reconcile_dealer_states` | Function body | Low priority (harmless in PostgreSQL) |
